"""
Classes related to finding a job that can run on available resources. Does
not assume any knowledge of how long each job will take. Designed for greedy
search of a job that will fit whenever resources are freed.

In the context of Cheetah workflows, it's unlikely that there will be more than
a few hundred jobs, so it's not worth optimizing the python search code very
much. It is however worth making sure that a job is run when resources are
available, since super computer resources are expensive. Basically it's worth
doing some work in python to make sure we start a big unit of work on compute
nodes.

    Uses a coordinated pair of sort list for costs and jobs, along with
    the bisect module. A linked list might be more efficient, since the
