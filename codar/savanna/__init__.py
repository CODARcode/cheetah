"""Classes for running pipelines of MPI tasks based on a specified
total process limit. The system is designed to use two + N threads:

1. consumer thread: get pipelines from queue and execute them when process
   slots become available. Stops when a None pipeline is received.

2. producer thread: add pipelines to queue. Can be from file or from network
   service.

3. monitor threads: each process spawned by the consumer thread has a monitor
   thread that blocks on the processes completing with a timeout, and kills the
   process if it's not done after the timeout is reached.
