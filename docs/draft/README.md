# CODAR Cheetah - The CODAR Experiment Harness

## Overview

* The CODAR Experiment Harness is designed to run Exascale science applications
  using different parameters and components to determine the best combination
  for deployment on different supercomputers.
* To use Cheetah, the user first writes a `campaign specification file` in python.
  In this file, one specifies:
     * which MPI programs to launch in parallel
     * what computing resources to give to those programs
     * which configuration files and binaries to copy to each experiment's directory
     * lists of possible values for some parameters (including computing resources) over which to do a grid search
     * how many times (iterations) to repeat each experiment to collect enough statistics
       to estimate the variability of the results.
* The campaign specification file does not define how programs communicate with each other.
  This is done in `adios2.xml` file that can be used to glue the input from one program
  with the output from another provided that all the involved programs are doing I/O using adios2.
  The data exchange can happen at each time step as the data is generated by producers.
  Adios2 shields a user from I/O details. Without recompiling a program, in `adios2.xml` file one
  can specify that output is written/read to/from a file or network socket, whether a producer should block
  for a certain number of reads by consumers or discard data after some timeout if consumers cannot keep up, etc.
* To generate shell scripts for all the specified experiments and a particular supercomputer,
  one executes  
  ```
  cheetah.py create-campaign -a <dir with configs & binaries> -o <top campaign dir> -e <specification file>.py -m <supercomputer>
  ```  
* The experiments are organized into separate subdirectories that contain
  all the necessary executables and configuration files to run each experiment separately if necessary.
  Each such directory would also contain each own log files so that one can later examine what went
  wrong with a particular experiment.
* The top level directory of the campaign contains `run-all.sh` file that one can use to launch
  the whole set of experiments on the allocated resources.
* There is also `cancel.sh` that allows to stop the whole campaign.
* As campaign runs, one can examine its progress with
  ```
  cheetah.py status <campaign dir>
  ```
  or generate a detailed report with
  ```
  cheetah.py generate-report
  ```
  Use `-h` option for a particular command to learn more details

## Cheetah installation
   * Dependency: python 3.5+
   * On supercomputers it should be installed on a parallel file system visible from compute/mother nodes
   * To install cheetah, do:
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:CODARcode/cheetah.git
     cd cheetah          
     python3 -m venv venv-cheetah
     source venv-cheetah/bin/activate
     pip install --editable .
     ```
## Setting up Cheetah environment
   ```
   cd <cheetah dir>
   source venv-cheetah/bin/activate
   ```
